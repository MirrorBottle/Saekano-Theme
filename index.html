                <p>Tomoya Aki, a male high school teenager who works part-time to fund his otaku lifestyle (anime,
                    dating sims, and related merchandise) encounters a beautiful girl one day during spring vacation. A
                    month later, he finds out that the girl is his classmate, Megumi, who is hardly noticeable to her
                    classmates. Hoping to create a visual novel computer game, he turns to school beauties Eriri Spencer
                    Sawamura for designing the art, and Utaha Kasumigaoka for writing the game scenario. Tomoya then
                    recruits Megumi to star as the "heroine" (the main character's love interest) of his game, thus
                    forming the development team "Blessing Software", in which the three most renowned students in the
                    school (Tomoya, Eriri, and Utaha) work on one of the least noticeable (Megumi). The series follows
                    their adventures in developing the game and their plans to sell it at the Comiket convention, as
                    well as the emotional entanglements among the team.</p>

                        With his childhood friend Eriri and student novelist Utaha, he starts a visual novel project
                        where
